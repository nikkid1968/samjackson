    <p>Do you see any Teletubbies in here? Do you see a slender plastic tag clipped to my shirt with my name printed on
        it? Do you see a little Asian child with a blank expression on his face sitting outside on a mechanical
        helicopter that shakes when you put quarters in it? No? Well, that's what you see at a toy store. And you must
        think you're in a toy store, because you're here shopping for an infant named Jeb. </p>

    <h1>No man, I don't eat pork</h1>
    <p>The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by the iniquities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men.
        Blessed is he who, in the name of charity and good will, shepherds the weak through the valley of darkness, for
        he is truly his brother's keeper and the finder of lost children. And I will strike down upon thee with great
        vengeance and furious anger those who would attempt to poison and destroy My brothers. And you will know My name
        is the Lord when I lay My vengeance upon thee. </p>

    <p>Now that we know who you are, I know who I am. I'm not a mistake! It all makes sense! In a comic, you know how
        you can tell who the arch-villain's going to be? He's the exact opposite of the hero. And most times they're
        friends, like you and me! I should've known way back when... You know why, David? Because of the kids. They
        called me Mr Glass. </p>

    <p class="p1">Now that there is the Tec-9, a crappy spray gun from South Miami. This gun is advertised as the most
        popular gun in American crime. Do you believe that shit? It actually says that in the little book that comes
        with it: the most popular gun in American crime. Like they're actually proud of that shit.

        Your bones don't break, mine do. That's clear. Your cells react to bacteria and viruses differently than mine.
        You don't get sick, I do. That's also clear. But for some reason, you and I react the exact same way to water.
        We swallow it too fast, we choke. We get some in our lungs, we drown. However unreal it may seem, we are
        connected, you and I. We're on the same curve, just on opposite ends.</p>
