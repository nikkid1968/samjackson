    <h1 style="color: orange;">About Samuel L Jackson</h1>

    <p>Born on December 21, 1948, in Washington, D.C.,</br> Samuel L. Jackson graduated from
        Morehouse College in 1972 and began his </br>acting career on stage. A move to New York City led to a
        friendship </br>
        with Spike Lee and his first movie gigs, before he enjoyed a </br>star-making turn with a commanding
        performance in Pulp Fiction. Jackson became a ubiquitous presence on the big screen,</br>
        appearing in big-budget films like Star Wars: The Phantom Menace </br>and its sequels, and the numerous
        installments of the Marvel </br>Cinematic Universe. In 2011 he was named the highest grossing actor of all
        time with more than $7.2 billion in wealth.</p>

        "Yeah, Zeus! As in, father of Apollo? Mt. Olympus? </br>
        Don’t f*ck with me, or I’ll shove a lightning bolt up</br>
        your ass? Zeus! You got a problem with that?"</br>

        Normally, both your asses would be dead as fucking fried chicken,</br> but you happen to pull this shit
        while I'm in</br>
        a transitional period so I don't wanna kill you,</br>
        I wanna help you. But I can't give you this case, it don't</br>
        belong to me. Besides, I've already been through too much shit this morning over this case to hand it over
        to your dumb ass.

    <blockquote> Well, the way they make shows is, they make one show. That show's called a pilot. Then they show
        that
        show
        to the people who make shows, and on the strength of that one show they decide if they're going to make
        more
        shows. Some pilots get picked and become television programs. Some don't, become nothing. She starred in
        one
        of the ones that became nothing.
