    <h2>No, motherfucker</h2>
    <p>Now that we know who you are, I know who I am. I'm not a mistake! It all makes sense! In a comic, you know
        how you can tell who the arch-villain's going to be? </p>
    <p>He's the exact opposite of the hero. And most times they're friends, like you and me! I should've known
        way back when... You know why, David? Because of the kids. They called me Mr Glass.</p>

    <h2>No man, I don't eat pork</h2>
    <p>Now that there is the Tec-9, a crappy spray gun from South Miami. This gun is advertised as the most popular
        gun in American crime. Do you believe that shit? It actually says that in the little book that comes
        with it: the most popular gun in American crime. Like they're actually proud of that shit. </p>

    <h2>I gotta piss</h2>
    Look, just because I don't be givin' no man a foot massage don't make it right for Marsellus to throw Antwone
    into a glass motherfuckin' house, fuckin' up the way the nigger talks. Motherfucker do that shit to me, he
    better paralyze my ass, 'cause I'll kill the motherfucker, know what I'm sayin'?

    <h2>Fried chicken</h2>
    Normally, both your asses would be dead as fucking fried chicken, but you happen to pull this shit while I'm in
    a transitional period so I don't wanna kill you, I wanna help you. But I can't give you this case, it don't
    belong to me. Besides, I've already been through too much shit this morning over this case to hand it over to
    your dumb ass.

    <h2>Are you ready for the truth?</h2>
    Your bones don't break, mine do. That's clear. Your cells react to bacteria and viruses differently than mine.
    You don't get sick, I do. That's also clear. But for some reason, you and I react the exact same way to water.
    We swallow it too fast, we choke. We get some in our lungs, we drown. However unreal it may seem, we are
    connected, you and I. We're on the same curve, just on opposite ends.

    <h2>No man, I don't eat pork</h2>
    Look, just because I don't be givin' no man a foot massage don't make it right for Marsellus to throw Antwone
    into a glass motherfuckin' house, fuckin' up the way the nigger talks. Motherfucker do that shit to me, he
    better paralyze my ass, 'cause I'll kill the motherfucker, know what I'm sayin'?
